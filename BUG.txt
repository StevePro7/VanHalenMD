05/12/2020

solution trialling out
reset all quiz_answer to 255 instead of 0
iterate thru and check if rnd = 255 then use this index

Confirm
that after loop that if the bug occurred that it does in fact occur here!
quiz manager
random()

repo 2x in a row
believe can "always" get the bug if 40x riffs and easy [and/or hard?]

Runnin' with the Devil is the first option but

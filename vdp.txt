I think I found the problem!

for some reason clearPlane was causing all sorts of crazy graphics glitches
VDP_clearPlane( BG_A, 0 );

so I removed and I currently just have this
engine_graphics_manager_clear_area

VDP_clearTileMapRect( BG_A, GAME_AREA_X, GAME_AREA_Y, GAME_AREA_W, GAME_AREA_H );
}


I may have FULL and use instead...

TODO must test FULL instead of clearPlane!!
